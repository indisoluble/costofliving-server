FIRST RAILS APP: COST OF LIVING
===============================

This is the first rails application I develop on my own. It implements a server which main purpose is to maintain a database with prices for different products all around the world.

It seems simple but this server receive/send data from/to a client application running on iOS, this means the same users that consult the database generate the information. They do this because this service is designed to work like a social network where you follow countries or cities, instead of people.
